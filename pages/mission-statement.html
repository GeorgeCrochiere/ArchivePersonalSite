        <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>To be able to integrate different forms of technology and artificial intelligence within the everyday lifestyle of workers and society, I want to be able to let people live the lives they want to pursue, while allowing for as many opportunities as possible in a safer world. These goals of wanting to do more for the people in my community, ranging from the large extensive one I will be a part of in the computing and software world, to the small one that I hope to have my daily life in, knowing the people who live around me, all come from wanting to do better as a person individually, wanting to make those who have supported me proud, and by wanting to prove to myself that I can make a difference in the world as many others before me have. </p>
        <p>With the Honors program, I hope to get more opportunities out of it than I would with the standard Clarkson experience being able to put my work to the test. I chose this path to show not only what I can do, but to also challenge myself to the next level in comparison to my high school experience. My largest current passion, extending from my Engineering Capstone that I completed in high school, is to help with the development of technology that can help make a beneficial impact on society, ranging from helping people live in safer communities, to developing communication systems for off-planet travel.</p>
